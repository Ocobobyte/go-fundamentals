# Constants

Constants are like variables, except they can not be modified once they have been declared

```go
// You can do
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  const gopher = "Gopher"
  fmt.Println(gopher)
}
```

```go
// You can not do
func main() {
  const gopher = "Gopher"
  gopher = "Bunny"
  fmt.Println(gopher)
}

// ./main.go:7:5: cannot assign to gopher
// (neither addressable nor a map index expression)

```

- Can be a constant
  - character (rune)
  - string
  - boolean
  - numeric (int, float, complex)
- Can not be a constant
  - map
  - slice

## Typed Constants

If you declare a constant with a type, it will be that exact type.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

const (
  leapYear = int32(366)
)

func main() {
  hours := 24
  fmt.Println(hours * leapYear) // multiplying int and int32 types
}

// invalid operation: hours * leapYear (mismatched types int and int32)
// fmt.Println(int32(hours) * leapYear) -> 8784

```

## Untyped Constants

Constants can be *untyped*, meaning that their type is inferred by the value assigned.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

const (
  year     = 365        // untyped
  leapYear = int32(366) // types
)

func main() {
  hours := 24
  minutes := int32(60)
  fmt.Println(hours * year)   // 8760
  fmt.Println(minutes * year) // 21900
  fmt.Printf("minutes * year = %[1]d (%[1]T)\n", minutes*year)
  fmt.Println(minutes * leapYear) // 21960
}
```

## Type Inference

It is important to remember that the *untyped* *const* or *var* will be converted to the *type* it is combined with for any operation for that type.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

const (
  year = 365 // untyped
)

func main() {
  minutes := int32(60)
  fmt.Println(minutes * year) // 21900
  fmt.Printf("minutes * year = %[1]d (%[1]T)\n", minutes*year)
}

// minutes * year = 21900 (int32)
```
